 * Space Shooter (Mini Project)
 * Problem Domain: Space shooter is a 2d shooting game where the goal is for the spaceship to stay alive for 1 minute.  
 * When a spaceship is created, it is given an initial strength level whose value is a random number between 100-150. 
 * The spaceship can move 10 pixels at a time. The ship can also shoot bullets when the space bar is pressed. The bullets 
 * shot by the ship move towards the right side of the screen in a straight line and disappear when the end of the screen 
 * is reached. The bullet’s damage is equal to the current ship strength. UFOs appear from the right side of the screen in
 * random positions and dies once hit by a bullet. When UFOs are spawned, its damage is randomized from 30 to 40 and its
 * speed is randomized from 1-5. At the start, there are 7 UFOs but 3 more are spawned every 5 seconds. When a UFO hits 
 * the spaceship, the spaceship’s strength is reduced by the UFO’s damage, and the UFO dies and disappears. When the 
 * spaceship’s strength reaches 0, the game is over and the ship loses.
 * Different power-ups can be collected by the spaceship:
 * Power-ups 		Effect
 * Star 		Makes the spaceship immortal
 * Heart	 	Doubles the strength of the spaceship
 * Coin			Adds 3 to the spaceship's speed
